Infinite scrolling is one of the most used UX in App. In React Native, This is implemented using the `onEndReached` props of FlatList.

Unfortunately, It doesn't work well as expected. I think it's one of the headaches that hasn't been solved for quite some time. We had to make it work by modifying `onEndReachedThreshold` several times, but eventually it doesn't work efficiently.

**Now, This patch will make it work as you expect! It's too easy to use.**

# History
[My PR](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/26444) is in progress, but React Native may not be easy to apply because there are so many things to consider. So, I decided to provide this patch for those who needed it.

# Usage

### Install
Once installed, react-native's FlatList is automatically patched.
```bash
yarn add react-native-infinite-flatlist-patch --dev
```

`prepare` should be added to prevent this patch from being restored whenever packages are changed.
```javascript
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...,
    "prepare": "yarn run infinite-flatlist-patch"
  }
}
```

If you were already using `prepare`, you can add the patch script later.
```javascript
"prepare": "yarn run jetify; yarn run infinite-flatlist-patch"
```

### Execute manually
You can execute the patch manually with the command below.
```bash
yarn run infinite-flatlist-patch
```

### Uninstall
Just delete the command you added to `prepare` and remove my package.
